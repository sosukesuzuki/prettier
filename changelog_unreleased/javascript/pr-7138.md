#### Tweak function composition logic for decorators ([#7138](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7138) by [@brainkim](https://github.com/brainkim))

Because decorators modify the line following, splitting a decorator callâ€™s
arguments onto multiple lines can obscure the relationship between the
decorator and its intended target, producing less-readable code. Therefore, the
function composition logic introduced in #6033 has been changed to exclude
decorator calls.

```jsx
// Input
export class Item {
  @OneToOne(() => Thing, x => x.item)
  thing!: Thing;
}

// Output (Prettier stable)
export class Item {
  @OneToOne(
    () => Thing,
    x => x.item,
  )
  thing!: Thing;
}

// Output (Prettier master)
export class Item {
  @OneToOne(() => Thing, x => x.item)
  thing!: Thing;
}
```
