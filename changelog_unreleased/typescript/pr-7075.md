#### Don't print trailing commas after rest elements in tuples ([#7075](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7075) by [@thorn](https://github.com/thorn0))

* A rest element is always the last element of a tuple type. Nothing can be added after it.
* While TS is okay with this comma, [Babel doesn't parse it](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10769)
* In function parameters and array destructuring, such a comma is a syntax error. Keeping it in tuples is inconsistent.
